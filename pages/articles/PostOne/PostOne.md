Hello all!

Welcome to my first post.

Starting now, I will try to update this blog at least once a week for the remainder of my project.

For an in-depth look at my research project, please take a look at the *about my research* page.  For the purpose of these posts, I will assume some preliminary knowledge in my project.

First, a few quick note about my blog posts.  I will be using [SketchFab](https://sketchfab.com/), an awesome resource that allows for easy sharing and viewing of 3D models.  It is fairly easy to use, just click the <i class="fa fa-play-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i> button and grab/move your mouse to rotate.  Double click to zoom, or if you are using a MacBook trackpad, you can pinch-to-zoom!

Below is the current version of my DALI Lab model.  If you want, you can scan the QR code below the model, which will open up a Google Cardboard version of model!  This is a really awesome feature that SketchFab offers, and is certainly worth looking at!

A quick note on timing for the project.  It is my goal to have the modeling, animation, coding mostly complete by the end of December/ beginning of January.  As evidenced by this first post, it is my goal to have the modeling complete within the next couple weeks.

Tomorrow (October 11) is a particularly exciting day, as I will be setting up the HTC Vive headset in the DALI Lab!!  I will post photos/ update tomorrow.
